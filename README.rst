Riptide is a set of tools to manage development environments for web applications.
It's using container virtualization tools, such as `Docker <https://www.docker.com/>`_
to run all services needed for a project.

It's goal is to be easy to use by developers.
Riptide abstracts the virtualization in such a way that the environment behaves exactly
as if you were running it natively, without the need to install any other requirements
the project may have.

Proxy Server
------------

This repository implements a HTTP(s) and WebSocket reverse proxy server for use with Riptide projects.
It supports auto-starting of Riptide projects. Routing of projects is based on hostnames.
